# python-singer-class
A simple example showing how classes and unit tests work in Python.

## Project Structure

- `singer.py`: Contains the `Singer` class with operator overloading, validation, and the `ConcertOrganizer` class.
- `main.py`: Reads data from a file and displays the singer(s) with the most concerts.
- `test.py`: Unit tests using the `unittest` module to validate core functionality.
- `enekesek.txt`: Input file with singer data in a specific format.

## Concepts Demonstrated

- Class creation and encapsulation
- Property decorators (`@property`)
- Operator overloading (`+`, `-`, `<`, `>`)
- Input validation with exceptions
- Working with files and parsing structured data
- Simple unit testing with `unittest`
